                Our school is the most prominent building in the town. It is a Christian convent school, and therefore it  has a beautiful<br> Catholic Church. Our school has lush green and tall palm trees in the front and a beautiful garden. It also has a vast<br> playground where all the students gather to eat lunch and play different sports, such as cricket and football. I enjoy <br>lunchtime most when I meet my friends from other sections.

Our school also has a massive auditorium with 500 seats.<br>It is famous for its annual function in the whole town. Our school is renowned for its many societies and clubs. I am a <br>member of the dance club and often perform on the stage of the auditorium.

My favourite go-to place in the school<br> is the library. Our school library is very big. It has 25 shelves and thousands of books from every genre. I enjoy reading<br> encyclopaedias very much. I go to the library daily. We can also borrow the books we like from the library.

Last year,<br> our school also won the “Best School Of The Town Award”. Everyone was very happy, and the principal distributed <br>sweets and candies among the children. It was an award well deserved.
